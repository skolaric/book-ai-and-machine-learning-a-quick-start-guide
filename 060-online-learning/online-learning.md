Differently from the development model where a new version of an LLM is created anew, there is another model of revising (upgrading) LLMs based on the notion of *online learning*.

Online learning for LLMs refers to the process where an LLM continues to learn and update its parameters incrementally as it receives new data, rather than being trained once and fixed. This ongoing learning approach allows the model to adapt in real-time to new information, user behavior, or changing environments without the need for full retraining from scratch. It helps maintain and improve model performance by incorporating fresh data continuously, which is especially useful for applications requiring up-to-date knowledge or personalization. 

Online learning can involve techniques such as fine-tuning on streaming data, reinforcement learning from user feedback, or incremental training batches. This contrasts with traditional offline learning where the model is trained once on a static dataset and then deployed. Online learning enables LLMs to stay relevant, aligned, and effective over time in dynamic real-world scenarios.
